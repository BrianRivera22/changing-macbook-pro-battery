<h1>Laptop repair: changing the battery of my old laptop</h1>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>My 2012 macbook pro was having a short battery life for a few years. It got to the point where I couldn’t get more than a few hours of use from it.</p> 

<h2>Here were some signs that I noticed:</h2>
<li>Reduced battery life: The laptop would lose battery much faster than it used to, even when fully charged.</li> 
<li>Sudden shutdowns: Laptop unexpectedly shut down even when the battery indicator showed a decent charge.</li> 
<li>Slow charging: Took a long time to fully charge the battery.</li>
<li>Inconsistent battery readings: Battery percentage fluctuated rapidly and didn't accurately reflect the actual charge</li>
 
<h2>Plan of action</h2>
<p>I decided to fix it myself at home and I did some research to buy the right battery based on my laptop model. In this case I bought a NinjaBatt Pro Battery which was compatible for a MacBook Pro 13” [Mid 2012 2010 and 2009].</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>I unscrewed the bottom of my MacBook Pro to reveal an old battery and I also noticed that the fan was dusty and decided I would clean everything while I was here. I carefully removed the battery and cleaned everything up with some compressed gas.</p>

<p>^This is what my laptop looked like after everything was clean and ready to go. I then fully charged my laptop and turned it back on to make sure that everything was working properly.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is the laptop with the new battery after I finished the quick repair project and it still works great a year later!</p>
